A php script to host a tv-show link website.

Features:
- Admin Panel
- User Accounts
- Logging
- Automatic iframe
- Automatic embed
- Download link generator
- Control for each user of his submissions
- Easy to use
- Voting System

The goal of this project is to create a script/website where people can watch tv shows on external video hosts without ads and without hassle.

When a link is submitted the internal converter converts the link into an embed link so the player (of the externel video hosting website) is iframed into the website. Which eliminates ads and waiting times.

Also people can add TV shows, episodes, seasons and link on their own. The user can keep track of his submissions.  All submissions must be approved by an administrator first before they are visible.

Also for some video hosting websites the 'download scrip' finds out the location of the file on the external video host which makes you able to download it.

Currently there is much work to be done on:
- Stability
- More features
- Security
- Crawler
- Design

The project is open-source for now. There is no need for contributions from anybody. Iam coding everything myself. You can just look at the code and use it if you want.
